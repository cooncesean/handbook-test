This directory contains our product requirements documents. The intent of each document is to align stakeholders around core functionality we seek to include with the delivery of each feature.

PRDs do not need to be lengthy documents; they are a tool for up front alignment and documentation to guide development and QA.

## Creating PRDs
Product requirement docs are typically created at the beginning of any medium to large sized project. There is [a template available here](/) should you need it.
