title: Technical Design Documents (TDDs)
sidebar_label: TDD readme
---
This directory contains our technical design documents. These documents serve a dual purpose:

#### Alignment
They are a tool that allow engineers to propose high-level technical solutions _before_ writing any code. A TDD is essentially a proposal opened as a pull request into this repository, such that the author can receive feedback as early in the development lifecycle as possible.

The aim is two-fold:

1. **Immediate Feedback:** Developers can receive feedback on their approach before breaking ground on code, reducing the amount of re-work that may need to be performed during the peer review process. Put simply, the goal is to prevent developers from doing a bunch of work, only to open a pull request that is rejected by the team because the underlying approach was unsound.
1. **Improved Design:** The more we can collaborate during the design phase, the more we improve our odds of arriving at a robust and extensible solution.

#### Reference Documentation
TDDs allow future maintainers to understand the motivation and context around the technical decisions that power our products. They serve as a source of truth for why specific decisions were made, as well as the conversation and thought process behind them.


## Creating TDDs
Technical design docs are typically created at the beginning of any medium to large sized project. There is [a template available here](/) should you need it.
