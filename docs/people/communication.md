At company, our approach to communication is empathetic, clear, and above all, collaborative. Without collaboration or a team-first mindset, progress becomes impossible. We all want to be on a rocketship towards financial freedom; in order to do that we need to constantly accept that where we were yesterday, is not where we will (or want) to be tomorrow. Change is inevitable and we need to focus on how we can continue growing and improving, personally, professionally, and collectively.

To better communicate across teams, we have a few guidelines that we suggest you read when messaging someone in Slack, or talking via Zoom.
