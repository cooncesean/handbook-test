Welcome to the Employee Handbook! üëã

If you're reading this for the first time, you are probably a new team member joining us. We are so excited to have you here! In this handbook, you will find üîç all the information you need to learn about how we run the Company, and how we have grown over time. As we continue growing, we will continue to add resources and knowledge relevant here.

You can think of this like an on-going project instead of something set in stone.

This will ultimately be a guide for anyone in the company that ever has questions around our daily operations, communication, benefits, policies and more. While putting this together, our guiding principle has been:


What questions would we have as a new hire who doesnt know anything about our company?


Of course, there will be things that are missing. And that is where your feedback will be most valuable. If you feel there is something we should add, remove or edit, please let the People & Talent Operations team know and we will make the necessary changes.
To get you started, here is a list of resources that will be able to answer most of your questions. This will also be a guide you can refer to at anytime for any Company-wide operations, People, and general questions.
